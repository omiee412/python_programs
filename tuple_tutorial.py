tup = (21,36,14,25)
print(tup) #in list we can change the values, but in tuple we cannot change the values.
print(tup[3]) #  []means list, () means tuple.
print(tup[1]) # [1] means element at position 1.
print(tup.count(14)) #no. of times the element is occur.
print(tup.index(14)) #position of element
tup.count(0)# set is almost same as list, diff is it would not maintain the sequence and it will not support duplicate values.
